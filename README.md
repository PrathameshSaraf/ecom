This is an Ecom Flutter app project.

In this project, I used the Stacked architecture, which is a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture that helps to separate the concerns of your app's components, making it easier to maintain and scale.

- auto_route: A Flutter navigation package that generates route helpers and provides strongly-typed routing and deep linking.
- stacked_generator: Code generation package for the Stacked architecture to streamline development.
